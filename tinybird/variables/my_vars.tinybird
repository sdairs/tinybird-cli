This is a variable file. Variables are not sensitive.

Variables are namespaced per file. 

The `name: my_vars` in the file frontmatter namespaces these variables with `my_vars`.

They are referenced in the query using `${vars.my_vars.env}`

They should not be case sensitive.

{% variable name="my_vars" %}
env: ${environment.ENV}
{% /variable %}
