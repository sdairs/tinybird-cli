This is a datasource.

A datasource is defined with 4 properties.

```
| Name | Type | JSONPath | Description |
```

By default, they are delimited by pipes (|). The delimiter is configurable.

This pretty much means the table block can be parsed as a CSV with a custom delimiter.

{% datasource name="my_ds" delimiter="|" %}
id|UUID|$.id|User ID
name|String|$.name|Person's full name
age|UInt8|$.age|Person's age
{% /datasource %}
