type: table

This is a table.

A table is defined with 4 properties.
| Name | Type | Expression | Description |

By default, they are delimited by pipes (|). The delimiter is configurable.

This pretty much means the table block can be parsed as a CSV with a custom delimiter.

{% table name="my_table" delimiter="|" %}
id|UUID|$.id|User ID
name|String|$.name|Person's full name
age|UInt8|$.age|Person's age
{% endtable %}
